Sticky Prototype v0.1.1
================

Sticky notes web app, client based, works in offline mode thanks to Firebase.

TODO:
--------------------
* authentification & security (will allow each user to have his private sticky notes)
* sharing of sticky notes among users (add collaborators)
* date/time detection & smart interaction (inline event creation & seemless integration with Google Calendar; notifications of upcoming tasks; ordering of tasks by due date)
* sticky note tagging/categorizing
* archiving of sticky notes & browsing

CHANGELOG:
--------------------
__v0.1.0__
_base functionality & UI_
