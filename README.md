Sticky Prototype v0.3.5
================

Sticky notes web app, client based, works in offline mode thanks to Firebase.

TO-DO:
--------------------
* authentification & security (will allow each user to have his private sticky notes)
* sharing of sticky notes among users (add collaborators)
* date/time detection & smart interaction (inline event creation & seemless integration with Google Calendar; notifications of upcoming tasks; ordering of tasks by due date)
* sticky note tagging/categorizing
* optimize FireBase connection & offline mode (persistent local storage in case of dropped connection; startup without internet connection)
* polishing of existing features (ctrl+enter should produce new to-do line;)

KNOWN BUGS:
--------------------
* loaded to-do items do not have clickable checkboxes
*
