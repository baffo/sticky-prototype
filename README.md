Sticky Prototype v0.2.1
================

Sticky notes web app, client based, works in offline mode thanks to Firebase.

TODO:
--------------------
* authentification & security (will allow each user to have his private sticky notes)
* sharing of sticky notes among users (add collaborators)
* date/time detection & smart interaction (inline event creation & seemless integration with Google Calendar; notifications of upcoming tasks; ordering of tasks by due date)
* sticky note tagging/categorizing

KNOWN BUGS:
--------------------
* transformed links are not clickable; click toggles line edit instead of url click
* ctrl+input breaks layout instead of adding "task item" with checkbox

CHANGELOG:
--------------------
__v0.2.0__
_archive implemented and possibility to add multiple pages; bugfixes_
__v0.1.0__
_base functionality & UI_
